# Proxy middleware UI (do not read this)

Remember these are optional, feel free to make your own, or just not care about giving your users control.

## Panel

When you click on the extension card, it will popup and additionally show you the manifest information and the source (where it came from). If it is a shadow middleware it will say "Shadowed by \<middleware name>"

## Storefront

This is includes the Panel, but also with an interface similar to the linux app centers. You will be able to view and manage apps from different repos. You will also be able to add repos. Default and recommended extensions can be provided by the site hoster.

### Implementation

This will use Lit.
